# Switch Case Dynamic Value (Paw Extension)

A Paw Extension that returns a different value depending on which case is match for test, such as switch-case statement does.

Case matching is just simple string equality test. 

As an example, in the screenshot, the environment variable "host" has either value of ip address or domain name depending on which environment is selected for environment variable "isServerAccessedBy".
